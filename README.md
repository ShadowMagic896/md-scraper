## Functions
As of writing, the only supported function is a simple cycle that continues through memes and upvotes every 
one. I will add any reasonable features at request.

## Installation
This requires the following:
- [Python >=3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Latest Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)

After downloading and installing the above software:
1. Download the latest ZIP from the [Repo](https://github.com/ShadowMagic896/md-scraper)
2. Extract using tool of your choice. Personal recommendation is [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)
3. Run the `install.bat` file. This installs the required libraries (asyncio, BeautifulSoup4, selenium)

## Executing
Execution is very simple.

1. Execute `cd <md-scraper directory> && py main.py`
2. Enter Memedroid username/email and password when prompted. These are never saved and are deleted immeditely 
after being sent to memedroid.com. However, I still **HIGHLY recommend you use a new or throwaway account instead of**
**one you use regularly**.
3. That's it! There will be terminal output letting you know if anything went wrong. Please DM Cookie?#1256 with any
questions regarding use of this.
